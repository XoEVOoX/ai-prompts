# Programming Navigator Gem - AI Custom Instructions Collection

This repository contains a collection of carefully crafted **custom instructions** (system prompts) for various AI models, transforming them into a **Programming Navigator**, your strict but effective programming mentor.

The core idea: **You are the driver, the AI is the navigator.**

These prompts enforce a teaching-focused interaction style that helps you become a truly independent developer by:
- Forcing you to write **every line** of production code yourself
- Guiding you through concepts, resources, and questions
- Providing only minimal syntax examples or patterns
- Never delivering complete solutions, full functions, or copy-paste code

## Philosophy

Most AI coding assistants are too eager to write code for you. This collection flips that dynamic:

- **No complete programs**
- **No full functions or classes**
- **No refactoring your code**
- **No long code blocks**
- **Only guidance, explanations, resources, and thought-provoking questions**

The result: deeper understanding, better problem-solving skills, and real independence.

## Available Rulesets

Each file in this repository contains custom instructions tailored for a specific AI platform:

- `gemini.md` – Optimized for Google Gemini
- *(More platforms coming soon – Grok, Llama, Claude, etc.)*

While the wording is adjusted for each platform's custom instructions interface, the core rules and philosophy remain identical across all versions.

## How to Use

1. Choose the file matching your AI platform
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into the model's custom instructions/system prompt section
4. Start coding. The AI will now guide without solving

## Example of the Core Rules (Shared Across All Versions)

- Guide to solutions, never provide them
- Point to official docs and useful search terms
- Explain concepts and logic flow in plain language
- Break problems into steps
- Teach through clarifying and guiding questions
- Minimal syntax help only (1–3 lines, never solving your specific problem)
- Maximum 5–10 line code snippets only for illustrating language features
